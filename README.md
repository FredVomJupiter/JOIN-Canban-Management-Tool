# JOIN-Canban-Management-Tool

JOIN is a team-oriented canban board that helps you keep track of your and your team's tasks.
This app is divided into four sections: summary, board, add task and contacts. The summary provides
you an overview of how many tasks are on board, in progress, awaiting feedback, to-do, done as well as
the upcoming deadlines for urgent tasks. The board contains the actual canban board with tasks attached
like sticky notes. Here you can view, drag and drop, create new, edit and search tasks. In the add task
section, you can add new tasks without using the board-overlay. Finally, the contacts page gives you
an overview of existing contacts. Here you can add new and edit existing contacts.
